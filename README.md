### Getting Started

**Step 1**. Make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6 or newer and
[Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) installed on your development machine.

**Step 2**. Clone this repository
 
**Step 3**. Compile and launch your app by running:

```shell
$ yarn start                    # Compiles the app and opens it in a browser with "live reload"
```

You can also test your app in release (production) mode by running `yarn start -- --release` or
with HMR and React Hot Loader disabled by running `yarn start -- --no-hmr`. The app should become
available at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).


### How to Test

The unit tests are powered by [chai](http://chaijs.com/) and [mocha](http://mochajs.org/).

```shell
$ yarn lint                     # Check JavaScript and CSS code for potential issues
$ yarn test                     # Run unit tests. Or, `yarn run test:watch`
```


### How to Deploy

Update `publish` script in the [`tools/publish.js`](tools/publish.js) file with your full Firebase
project name as found in your [Firebase console](https://console.firebase.google.com/). Note that
this may have an additional identifier suffix than the shorter name you've provided. Then run: 

```shell
$ yarn publish                  # Builds and deployes the app to Firebase
```

The first time you publish, you will be prompted to authenticate with Google and generate an
authentication token in order for the publish script to continue.

If you need to build the project without publishing it, simply run:

```shell
$ yarn build                    # Compiles the app into the /public/dist folder
```
